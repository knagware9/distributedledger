## :heart: Adding something new?
We do love to enhance [Distributed Ledger](https://github.com/tallyxinc/distributedledger) with you to become more powerful! 
The best way to workout your idea is to discuss it first at our dev mailing list:

* oss@tallyx.com

Please, if you can, don't just throw us the code of a new feature; lets figure first together 
what would be the best approach regarding the current architecture and future plans, 
before any development. 
This way we all get sure that your idea is aligned with the codebase and you can enjoy 
your happy coding even more :)
